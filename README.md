# Responsive Layouts for Email

A few layout ideas for HTML email that adapt to small screens and respond to breakpoints. It also includes a few tricks to a few HTML email gotchas in such as margins in Outlook, auto-detected links in Yahoo, and background images in Outlook.

This template *is not* meant to be used out of the box. Any email derived from this code should always be tested.

## Demo

## Tested In
* Webmail: Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo!, AOL
* Desktop Mac: Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Outlook Mail (OSX)
* Desktop Windows: Outlook (2007, 2010)
* iPhone (4, 4S, 5), iPod (Retina), iPad (1, 2, 3, Mini): iOS Mail, GMail
* Google Nexus (Android 4.3): Android Email, GMail

## Known Issues
* **Gmail** strips out the <style> tag and displayed only inline styles. Since this disables media queries on small screens, Gmail displays a shrunk version of the desktop layout.
