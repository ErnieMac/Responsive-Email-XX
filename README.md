# Responsive Layouts for Email

A few layout ideas for HTML email that adapt to small screens and respond to breakpoints. It also includes a few tricks to a few HTML email gotchas in such as margins in Outlook, auto-detected links in Yahoo, and background images in Outlook.

This template *is not* meant to be used out of the box. Any email derived from this code should always be tested.

## Tested In
* Webmail services: Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo!, and AOL.
* Mobile: iOS Mail and Android Email.
* Desktop clients: Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Outlook (2007, 2010), and Outlook Mail (OSX).
* Devices: iPhone (4, 4S, 5), iPod (Retina), iPad (1, 2, 3, Mini), Asus Transformer tablet, Windows desktop, Mac desktop

## Known Issues
* **Gmail iOS** - Gmail (desktop and mobile) strips out <style> tag, disabling all media queries. So Gmail gets the desktop layout, shrunk down (somewhat graceful degradation).
