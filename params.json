It also includes a few tricks to a few HTML email gotchas in such as margins in Outlook, auto-detected links in Yahoo, and background images in Outlook.\r\n\r\nThis template *is not* meant to be used out of the box. Any email derived from this code should always be tested.\r\n\r\n## Tested In\r\n* Webmail services: Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo!, and AOL.\r\n* Mobile: iOS Mail and Android Email.\r\n* Desktop clients: Apple Mail, Thunderbird, Outlook (2007, 2010), and Outlook Mail (OSX).\r\n* Devices: iPhone (4, 4S, 5), iPod (Retina), iPad (1, 2, 3, Mini), Asus Transformer tablet, Windows desktop, Mac desktop\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* **Gmail iOS** - Gmail (desktop and mobile) strips out <style> tag, disabling all media queries.
